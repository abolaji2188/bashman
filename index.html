                A celestial dance of stars aligns,
As your special day divine,
Unfolds with promise, love, and light,
A celebration of life's precious sight.
You are the sunshine in our family's sky,
Warming hearts, banishing life's sigh,
A brother, friend, and guiding ray,
Illuminating paths, come what may.
May Allah's blessings, like autumn rain,
Nourish your soul, and quench life's pain,
Granting wisdom, health, and peaceful nights,
And filling your heart with delight.
In this new year, may your dreams take flight,
On wings of hope, and morning light,
May success and joy, like golden threads,
Weave a tapestry of happiness in your head.
Thank you,for being a shining star,
A constant presence, near and far,
I love you more than words can say,
On your birthday, and every day.
